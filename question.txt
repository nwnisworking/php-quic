Hello guys,

I am currently building a WebTransport socket which follows the RFC9000/RFC9001 directive and I stumbled upon an issue where I can't decrypt the payload. This is going to be a long post. To get started, this is how initial packet looks like.
```
Initial Packet{
Header Form - 1 bit = 1
Fixed Bit - 1 bit = 1
Packet Type - 2 bits = 0
Reserved Bits - 2 bits,
Packet Number Length - 2 bit,
Version - 4 byte,
Destination Connection ID Length - 1 byte = 8
Destination Connection ID - 8 byte (Size is based on Destination Connection ID Length)
Source Connection ID Length - 1 Byte = 0,
Source Connection ID Length - 0 Byte (Size is based on Source Connection ID Length),
Token Length - 1 Byte = 0,
Token - 0 Byte (Size is based on Token Length)
Length - 2 Byte 
Packet Number - ??? (Mask[1, 4] ^ 4 byte after Length)
Packey Payload - ???  
}
```

The way it works, we will need to create the client
